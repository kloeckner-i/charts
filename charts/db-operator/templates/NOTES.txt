Release information
The Chart name: {{ .Chart.Name }}.
The Repo URL: https://db-operator.github.io/charts
The Release name {{ .Release.Name }}.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking changes and migration paths

{{ .Chart.Version }} is not breaking, you don't have to worry 

{{- if not .Values.crds.install }}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You've chosen not to install CRDs with this release.

We officially do not distribute CRDs outside of this helm chart, so 
you will have to deal with that on your own. 

If it was a mistake, update the values so they contain the following:

".Values.crds.install: true"

{{- end }}
{{- if not .Values.webhook.enabled }}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You've chosen not to install and configure the webhook.
Your "kinda.rocks" manifests won't be validated and converted when 
the API version is upgraded.

It's not required by db-operator to work, but if you want to have the 
webhook in place, you can set ".Values.webhook.enabled" to "true"
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.tests.gsql.enabled }}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You seem to have the gsql test set to true, usually, 
it shouldn't be done.

Make sure that you want to run tests, and not using this installation
in production in any form.

Or set '.Values.tests.gsql.enabled' to 'false'
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.tests.postgres.enabled }}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You seem to have the postgresql test set to true, usually, 
it shouldn't be done.

Make sure that you want to run tests, and not using this installation
in production in any form.

Or set '.Values.tests.postgres.enabled' to 'false'

Also, if you want to test your postgresql installation, you need to 
provide a postgres server yourself. Test itself doesn't deploy a server
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.tests.mysql.enabled }}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You seem to have the mysql test set to true, usually, 
it shouldn't be done.

Make sure that you want to run tests, and not using this installation
in production in any form.

Or set '.Values.tests.mysql.enabled' to 'false'

Also, if you want to test your mysql installation, you need to 
provide a mysql server yourself. Test itself doesn't deploy a server
{{- end }}
